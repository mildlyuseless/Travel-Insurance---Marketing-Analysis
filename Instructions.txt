INTRODUCTION

This notebook contains the case study of travel insurance from Travel Assured! Travel Assured is a travel insurance
company. Due to the COVID pandemic, they have had to cut their marketing budget by over 50%. It is more important than
ever that they advertise in the right places and to the right people.

Travel Assured has plenty of data on their current customers as well as people who got quotes but never bought insurance.
They want to know if there are differences in the travel habits between customers and non-customers - they believe they
are more likely to travel often (buying tickets from frequent flyer miles) and travel abroad. Our business task is to
uncover any insights from these data that might help the marketing strategy.

ASK

From our business task, we can ask the following questions:

What are the differences in the travel habits between customers and non-customers?

How can these travel habits be turned into marketing opportunities?

PREPARE

Since the data set for our project was provided by a primary data source: Travel Assured, we are assured that the data
is reliable. However it is a good practice that we check the data before we begin to carry on any analysis.
